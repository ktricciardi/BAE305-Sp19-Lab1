# Lab 1 - Well-Equipped

# By: Katie Ricciardi and Whitney Phelps
# Summary
This lab was designed to get us familiar with the main electronic equipment, such as a digital multimeter, an oscilloscope, a function generator, and a direct current power supply. Using different materials, like resistors and capacitors, we tested the uses of these pieces of equipment and saw how accurate they were. We also looked at different voltages on the DC power supply and the function generator. We found the Fluke multimeter to be more accurate than the generic one. 
# Materials
* 1.2 kΩ resistor
* 4700 kΩ resistor

* 100 μF polarized capacitor
* 10 μF polarized capacitor
* .01 μF non-polarized capacitor
* 1 μF non-polarized capacitor 

# Test Equipment
List multimeters and other equipment used for testing and creating results.
# Test Procedures
We first tested four resistors to determine their resistance values using both the Fluke and Generic DMMS. After

# Discussion
Did you make any design decisions that had an impact on the results? How did they impact the results? What do the results mean?
