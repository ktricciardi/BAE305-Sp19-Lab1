# Lab 1 - Well-Equipped

# By: Katie Ricciardi and Whitney Phelps
# Summary
This lab was designed to get us familiar with the main electronic equipment, such as a digital multimeter, an oscilloscope, a function generator, and a direct current power supply. Using different materials, like resistors and capacitors, we tested the uses of these pieces of equipment and tested their accuracy. We also tested different output voltages on the DC power supply and the function generator using the fluke and generic multimeter. We found the Fluke multimeter to be more accurate than the generic one.

# Test Procedures
We first tested four resistors to determine their resistance values. We determined the expected resistance values using the color code on each individual resistor before using the Fluke and generic Digital Multimeters (DMMs). Second we measured and verified the capacitance of four different capacitors using the printed code on each capacitor to find the expected capacitance and the FLuke and generic DMMs to find the actual capacitance. We then measured the voltage output of the Direct Current Power Supply (DCPS) by measuring five different output voltages using the Fluke DMM. The five output voltages we tested were +1.5Vk, +7.0V, +12.0V, and +5.0V. 
Once we determined that the DCPS output voltage meter readings matched those of our DMMs, we tested the output amplitude and frequency of the Function Generator (FG). We connected a proto board to the FG and to an oscilloscope before setting the FG to produce a sine wave maximum amplitude of 2kHz. Using five different methods, we determined the amplitude and frequency of the sine wave. The five diffferent methods we used were 1) "counting squares" on the oscilloscope screen grid, 2) using the moveable cursors on the oscilloscope, 3) u7sing the "measure" feature on the oscilloscope, 4) using the generic DMM, and 5) using the Fluke DMM.
