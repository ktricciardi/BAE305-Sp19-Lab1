# Lab 1 - Well-Equipped

# By: Katie Ricciardi and Whitney Phelps
# Summary
This lab was designed to get us familiar with the main electronic equipment, such as a digital multimeter, an oscilloscope, a function generator, and a direct current power supply. Using different materials, like resistors and capacitors, we tested the uses of these pieces of equipment and tested their accuracy. We also tested different output voltages on the DC power supply and the function generator using the fluke and generic multimeter. We found the Fluke multimeter to be more accurate than the generic one. We also became familiar with GitHub by completeling the "Hello World" tutorial and creating our first repository.

# Test Procedures
We first tested four resistors to determine their resistance values. We determined the expected resistance values using the color code on each individual resistor before using the Fluke and generic Digital Multimeters (DMMs). Second, we measured and verified the capacitance of four different capacitors using the printed code on each capacitor to find the expected capacitance and the FLuke and generic DMMs to find the actual capacitance. We then measured the voltage output of the Direct Current Power Supply (DCPS) by measuring five different output voltages using the Fluke DMM. The five output voltages we tested were +1.5V, +7.0V, +12.0V, and +5.0V. 
Once we determined that the DCPS output voltage meter readings matched those of our DMMs, we tested the output amplitude and frequency of the Function Generator (FG). We connected a proto board to the FG and to an oscilloscope before setting the FG to produce a sine wave maximum amplitude of 2kHz. Using five different methods, we determined the amplitude and frequency of the sine wave. The five diffferent methods we used were 1) "counting squares" on the oscilloscope screen grid, 2) using the moveable cursors on the oscilloscope, 3) using the "measure" feature on the oscilloscope, 4) using the generic DMM, and 5) using the Fluke DMM.

# Discussion
Q1: Do the instruments agree with each other and with the expected value?
This question refers to the difference between our measured and expected resistance and capacitance of our four resitors and four capacitors. For the four resistors, the measured resistance is within the tolerance parameters of the expected resistance value. 

Q2: Do the instruments agree with each other?
This question refers to the difference between the output voltage set on the DC power supply, and our measured output voltage measured by the digital multimeter. All of the measured voltages were similar to the set voltages, with +1.5V measuring within 10% of the set voltage, and the other 3 voltages within 5% of the set voltage. 

Q3: Do the instruments agree?
This question refers to the function generator and the five different ways we needed to measure the amplitude and frequency. Overall, the instruments did agree. For amplitude, all the results were between 8.0 and 8.9 amps, and for frequency, between 1.99 and 2.02 kHz.
